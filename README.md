# example-e2e-stories
This repo serves a purpose of showing how [e2e-stories](https://github.com/avocode/e2e-stories) can be used for writing tests.

In the test/stories folder you can find yaml files, which are our stories, they can serve a good example how you can write tests.

In the test/spec folder you can find already converted stories to proper jest and puppeteer tests.

You can even look how e2e-stories setup was done if you would have problems with yours.
